## Objective
To build a solid understanding of SoC fundamentals and practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & GTKWave).

## What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
A System-on-Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that consolidates all components of a computer or other electronic systems into a single chip. Typically, an SoC includes a central processing unit (CPU) with memory, input/output, and data storage control functions, along with optional features like a graphics processing unit (GPU), Wi-Fi connectivity, and radio frequency processing. This high level of integration minimizes the need for separate, discrete components, thereby enhancing power efficiency and simplifying device design.

## Components of a Typical SoC
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The primary computational engine.  
- **Memory:** Includes RAM, ROM, and storage elements.  
- **Peripherals:** Interfaces like UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, etc.  
- **Interconnects:** Buses and networks (e.g., AMBA, CoreConnect) that facilitate communication between components.

## Why BabySoC is a Simplified Model for Learning SoC Concepts
BabySoC is a compact SoC featuring:

- **RVMYTH:** A simple RISC-V-based CPU core.  
- **PLL:** An 8x Phase-Locked Loop for stable clock generation.  
- **DAC:** A 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter for interfacing with analog devices.  

Its primary purpose is to integrate and test these IPs collaboratively and calibrate the analog part of the SoC.

## The Role of Functional Modelling Before RTL and Physical Design Stages
Functional modelling serves as a crucial step in the SoC design process, allowing designers to:

- **Verify Logic:** Ensure that the integrated components function as intended.  
- **Identify Issues Early:** Detect potential design flaws before moving to more resource-intensive stages.  
- **Optimize Performance:** Evaluate and refine the design for efficiency.  
- **Reduce Costs:** Minimize the risk of costly revisions in later stages.  

By simulating the BabySoC using tools like Icarus Verilog and GTKWave, we can visualize waveforms and verify the functionality of the PLL, DAC, and other components, ensuring a robust design before proceeding to RTL and physical design stages.
